Version 1.0
+Simple frame-by-frame playback
+Requires binaries to work (provided by me)
+Not terribly memory efficient
	+Frequent read/write calls just to get normal-ish playback
+Can mark keyframes with controller state
	+Frequent saves in case of crash
+Can save keyframe data to a CSV for later comparison and visualization
+Realtime playback

todo:
Make all the binaries
Add support for logging:
	face buttons
	triggers
	confirm/deny
autosave
eliminate need for the datafile to know how many frames there are. we can just count

Future Versions:
+Support varied framerates
+Multivideo playback
+Multiple input tracks at once (do we really want this? might make the UI too confusing)
+Audio
+Move keyframes after they've moved
