# Framescop: Giftscop Edition #
This tool is used to analyze Petscop videos frame by frame and manually record the player's inputs. Originally made by [notexplosive](https://github.com/notexplosive), I have modified it to better suit the needs of the Giftscop community. You can find the latest build in the releases section. In case you want to, you can go to the [old itch.io page](https://notexplosive.itch.io/framescop) to download the original version.
