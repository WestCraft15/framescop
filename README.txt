Thank you for downloading Framescop: Giftscop Edition (v0.2).

There are several improvements over the main version of Framescop that will
hopefully make this more useful for recerating inputs to use in Giftscop.

Included in this folder is a changelog file so you can see the various
changes made in this version of Framescop.

I have also included a short tutorial and a couple of tips below to help
new users get started.

If you find any bugs (which you probably will, as this is a development
build), please DM WestCraft#0744 on Discord with any information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tutorial:

First, download an episode of Petscop, which can be done by going to
giftscop.com/etc/petscop/[Episode Number] and downloading the video.

Next, you need to convert the video file into files that giftscop can use.
To do this, drag and drop the downloaded video file onto the
"frame_extractor" file in the Framescop folder and name the video.

Now, open Framescop and select the video you just created.

To start Framescopping, use the arrow buttons in the lower middle of the
screen to move forwards and backwards in the video, and when it looks like
the player presses a button, click the coresponding button in the lower
right.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips:

The player character's animations are not a reliable source of inputs, as
they start and end later than the button is pressed or released (typically
one frame after the button is pressed and two frames after it is released).

-- TODO Add tips here
