Version 1.0
+Simple frame-by-frame playback
+Requires binaries to work (provided by me)
+Not terribly memory efficient
	+Frequent read/write calls just to get normal-ish playback
+Can mark keyframes with controller state
	+Frequent saves in case of crash
+Can save keyframe data to a CSV for later comparison and visualization
+Realtime playback

Requested Features on my radar:
+Maintain aspect ratio

Version 1.4:
+ Mouse support

Future Versions:
+Support varied framerates
+Controller support?
	+Might be more comfortable for some people? idk
+Multivideo playback
+Multiple input tracks at once (do we really want this? might make the UI too confusing)
+Audio
+Move keyframes after they've been created (maybe? might make UI to complicated)
+Better save UI so you can distinguish marvin/paul on the same video
