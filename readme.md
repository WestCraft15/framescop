# Framescop: Giftscop Edition #
This tool is used to analyze Petscop videos frame by frame and manually record the player's inputs. Originally made by [notexplosive](https://github.com/notexplosive), I ([WestCraft15](https://github.com/WestCraft15)) have modified it to better suit the needs of the Giftscop community. I have added builds to the releases section, so there is no longer a need for outside links.
