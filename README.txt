Thank you for downloading Framescop: Giftscop Edition.

This version has several improvements over the original Framescop that will
hopefully make this better at recreating inputs for use in Giftscop.
changelog.txt has a full list of the modifications I made.

I have included a short tutorial below to help new users get started, but it
is still recommended for those who haven't used this version before.

If you find any bugs during use please DM WestCraft15#0744 on Discord or
tweet @WestCraft15 on Twitter.

Tutorial

First, download an episode of Petscop, which can be done by going to
giftscop.com/etc/petscop/[Episode Number] and downloading the video.

Next, drag and drop the downloaded video onto the frame_extractor.bat file
in the Framescop folder and name the video.

Now, open Framescop, enter your username, and select the video.

To start Framescopping, use the arrow buttons in the lower middle of the
screen to move forwards and backwards in the video. When the player appears
to have pressed a button, click the corresponding button in the lower right.

When you're done, press CTRL+S to save your work. To view the file you
just made, relaunch Framescop and press the "Show Saves" button.

If you ever want to delete a video, click the delete button with both the
left and right mouse buttons simultaneously (This doesn't delete the .tsv).
