Thank you for downloading Framescop: Giftscop Edition.

There are several improvements over the main version of Framescop that will
hopefully make this more useful for recerating inputs to use in Giftscop.

Included in this folder is a changelog file so you can see the various
changes made in this version of Framescop.

I have also included a short tutorial below to help new users get started,
but it is still recommended for those who haven't used this version before.

If you find any bugs (which you probably will, as this is a development
build), please DM WestCraft15#0744 on Discord with any information.

Tutorial

First, download an episode of Petscop, which can be done by going to
giftscop.com/etc/petscop/[Episode Number] and downloading the video.

Next, drag and drop the downloaded video onto the frame_extractor.bat
file in the Framescop folder and name the video.

Now, open Framescop and select the video you just created.

To start Framescopping, use the arrow buttons in the lower middle of the
screen to move forwards and backwards in the video, and when it looks like
the player presses a button, click the coresponding button in the lower
right.

When you're done, press CTRL+S to save your work. To view the file you
just made, relaunch Framescop and press the "Show Saves" button.

If you ever want to delete a video, click the delete button with both the
left and right mouse buttons simultaneously (This doesn't delete the .tsv).
