# Framescop: Giftscop Edition #
This tool is used to analyze Petscop videos frame by frame and manually record the player's inputs. Originally made by [notexplosive](https://github.com/notexplosive), I ([WestCraft15](https://github.com/WestCraft15)) have modified it to better suit the needs of the Giftscop community. You can find the latest build in the releases section. Alternatively, you can go to the [old download page](https://notexplosive.itch.io/framescop) to get the original version.
